                             If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom 
                             grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough 
                             to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself,
                             <q>Somewhere, my flower is there<q> But if the sheep eats the flower, 
                             in one moment all his stars will be darkened And you think that is not 
                             important!

                             To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just 
                             like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of 
                             you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing 
                             more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, 
                             then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you,
                              I shall be unique in all the world.
