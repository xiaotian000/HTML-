            <h1>Light music</h1>
            <p>
                <em>Light music</em> is a generic term applied to a mainly British musical style of "light" orchestral music, 
                which originated in the 19th century and had its heyday during the early to mid part of the 20th century, 
                although arguably it lasts to the present day.
                The style is a less "serious" form of Western classical music, 
                featuring through-composed, usually shorter orchestral pieces 
                and suites designed to appeal to a wider audience than more serious compositions. 
                The form was especially popular during the formative years of radio broadcasting, 
                with stations such as the BBC Light Programme featuring a playlist largely consisting 
                of light compositions.<a href="http://y.qq.com">QQ Music</a>
                Occasionally known as mood music or concert music, 
                light music is often grouped with the easy listening genre, 
                although this designation is misleading.Although mainly a British phenomenon, 
                light music was also popular in the U.S. and Europe, 
                and many compositions in the genre are still familiar through their use as film,
                radio and television themes.

            <h1>Country music</h1>
            <p>
                 <em>Country music</em> (or country and Western) is a blend of traditional and popular musical
                 forms traditionally found in the Southern United States and the Canadian Maritimes 
                 that evolved rapidly beginning in the 1920s. Distinctive variations of the genre 
                 have also emerged elsewhere including Australian country music.<a href="http://y.qq.com">

                American popular music had a great effect on music across the world. 
                It appeared early in the 19th century, and in the 20th century the American music 
                industry developed a series of new forms of music, using blues and other elements 
                of American folk music. These popular styles included country, R&B, jazz and rock. 
                The 1960s and '70s saw a number of important changes in American popular music, 
                including the development of a number of new styles, such as heavy metal, punk, soul, 
                and hip hop. Though these styles were not popular in the sense of mainstream, 
                they were commercially recorded and are thus examples of popular music.
