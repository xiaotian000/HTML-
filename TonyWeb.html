        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already,and I passed through 
            some interesting places on the way:Walla Walla,WA,Magic City,
            ID,Bountiful,UT,Last Chance,CO,Why,AZ and Truth or Consequences,NM.

        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            "Passing cars,When you can not see,May get you,A glimpse,
            of eternity."I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        <p>
            My first day of the trip!I can not believe I finally got everything
            packed and ready to go.Because I am on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring
            a whole lot with me:cell phone,ipod,digital camera,and a protein bar.
            Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said,"A journey of a thousand
            miles begins with one Segway. "
